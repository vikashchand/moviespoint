# Movie Library Web Application

This is a movie library web application created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API, create lists of movies, and share those lists publicly or keep them private.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** Users can sign in or sign up to access the application.
2. **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies and view their details.
3. **Create Movie Lists:** Users can create lists of movies, similar to YouTube playlists.
4. **Public and Private Lists:** Lists can be set as either public (accessible via a link) or private (only visible to the creator).
5. **Nice Layout:** The application's layout is designed to be user-friendly, taking inspiration from popular websites and applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## Steps to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```
6. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
